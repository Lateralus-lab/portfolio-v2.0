              <p>I am a passionate developer looking to make an impact in this world. There are a few
                things that mean the most to me. My family, my friends, my love for a healthy lifestyle,
                building for the web and doing my part in making this a better world.</p>
              <p>I'm currently seeking out the right team where I can work with other passionate
                individuals to build digital products that positively impact people lives. I believe in
                always exceeding expectations and continuously learning to be the best in my craft.</p>
              <p>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably at the gym or having an awesome
                time with friends or family.</p>
